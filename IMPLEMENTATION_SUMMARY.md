# Number Guesser Game - Implementation Summary

## Project Completed Successfully ✅

This document summarizes the complete implementation of the Number Guesser Game for Web3Bridge Cohort XIV Pre-Qualification Exercise.

## What Was Implemented

### Core Features

- ✅ Random secret number generation (1-100)
- ✅ Interactive graphical user interface
- ✅ Real-time feedback system (too high, too low, correct)
- ✅ Attempt tracking with limit management
- ✅ Win/loss detection and messaging

### Optional Features

- ✅ **Difficulty Levels**: Three difficulty settings
  - Easy: 15 attempts
  - Medium: 10 attempts (default)
  - Hard: 5 attempts
- ✅ **Restart Functionality**: Restart game without page reload
- ✅ **Animations**: Beautiful Tailwind CSS animations
  - Slide-in feedback
  - Shake animation on invalid input
  - Bounce-in for game over messages
  - Hover effects

### Error Handling

- ✅ Input validation (numbers only, 1-100 range)
- ✅ Empty input handling
- ✅ Non-numeric input detection
- ✅ User-friendly error messages
- ✅ Prevent submissions after game ends

### Technology Stack

- ✅ **React 18** with functional components
- ✅ **TypeScript** for type safety
- ✅ **Tailwind CSS** for modern styling
- ✅ **Vite** for fast development
- ✅ **Vitest** for testing (modern alternative to Jest)
- ✅ **React Testing Library** for component testing

### Testing

- ✅ Comprehensive test suite
- ✅ Unit tests for game logic
- ✅ Component tests for all UI components
- ✅ Integration tests for complete game flow
- ✅ Edge case testing (boundary values, invalid inputs)

### Git Workflow

- ✅ Initial Git repository setup
- ✅ Feature branches created:
  - `feature/core-game-logic`
  - `feature/ui-components`
  - `feature/optional-features`
  - `feature/testing`
- ✅ Atomic commits with clear messages
- ✅ Branch management demonstrated

### Documentation

- ✅ Comprehensive README.md with:
  - Game description and rules
  - How to play instructions
  - Installation steps
  - Available difficulty levels
  - Technology stack details
- ✅ Code comments and documentation

### Deployment

- ✅ GitHub Pages configuration
- ✅ GitHub Actions workflow for CI/CD
- ✅ Production build verified
- ✅ Deployment scripts added

## Project Structure

```bash
npm install
npm run dev`
```

### Run Tests

```bash
npm test
npm run test:coverage
```

### Build for Production

```bash
npm run build
```

### Deploy to GitHub Pages

1. Push code to GitHub repository
2. Enable GitHub Pages in repository settings
3. GitHub Actions will automatically deploy

## Features Highlight

### Difficulty Levels

Players can choose from three difficulty levels, each with different attempt limits to adjust the challenge level.

### Smooth Animations

The game features polished animations using Tailwind CSS:

- Feedback messages slide in smoothly
- Invalid inputs trigger a shake animation
- Game over messages bounce in
- Interactive elements have hover effects

### Error Handling

The game gracefully handles all edge cases:

- Non-numeric inputs
- Numbers outside the valid range
- Empty submissions
- Game state management
